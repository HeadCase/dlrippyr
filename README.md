# dlrippyr

`dlrippyr` is a command-line tool for re-encoding video media libraries to the
*H*igh *E*fficiency *V*ideo *C*oding (HEVC/H.265) codec. 

The ubiquitous usage of *A*dvanced *V*ideo *C*oding (AVC/H.264) over the last
15+ years means that many content libraries consume far more hard drive space
than necessary. `dlrippyr` seeks to address this by providing a simple
command-line interface that allows users to re-encode video files. It supports
both ad hoc, single file encoding and parsing and processing of directories
and hierarchies.

*Please note*: `dlrippyr` is currently in pre-alpha and thus provides no
tangible functionality
