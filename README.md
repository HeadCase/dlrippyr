# dlrippyr

`dlrippyr` is a command-line tool for re-encoding video media libraries to the
x265 (HEVC) codec. 

The ubiquitous usage of the x264 over the last 15+ years means that many
content libraries consume far more hard drive space than necessary. `dlrippyr`
seeks to address this by providing a simple command-line interface that allows
users to re-encode video files. It supports both ad hoc, single file encoding
and parsing and processing of directories and hierarchies.

*Please note*: `dlrippyr` is currently in pre-alpha and thus provides no
tangible functionality
