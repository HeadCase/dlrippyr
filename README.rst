``dlrippyr`` is a command-line tool for re-encoding video media libraries to the
High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC/H.265) codec. 

The ubiquitous usage of Advanced Video Coding (AVC/H.264) over the last 15+
years means that many content libraries consume far more hard drive space than
necessary. ``dlrippyr`` seeks to address this by providing a simple command-line
interface that allows users to re-encode video files. It supports both ad hoc,
single file encoding and parsing and processing of directories and hierarchies.

.. note:: ``dlrippyr`` is currently in is in alpha and thus does not guarantee
   stability
